        <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
        <p>In this project 3-2, we added features to rendering our images by modeling how different materials
            reflect/refract light and changing from a pinhole camera model to a thin lens camera model. We first
            completed part 1 of the project where we wrote functions to deal with reflecting and refracting light and
            creating glass materials to showcase both effects. We ran into issues with setting the pdf function, and our
            R value but were able to debug them and finish rendering images that involved reflection and refraction! We
            then completed part 4 of the project in which we model a thin lens camera by converting the camera space which
            only viewed a view from one point to a circular thin lens in which you can adjust the radius (aperture) and set
            a focal distance. This involved some code from project 3-1, part 1 but were able to use this to correctly find
            the ray from the camera to the world. This allows us to render more different types of materials realistically
            and adjust our aperture and focal distance to create more interesting and realistic images! </p>

    <h2 align="middle">Part 1: Mirror and Glass Materials</h2>
        <p>
            In part 1 we first implemented our reflect function by using the perfect specular reflection function detailed
        in lecture 14, using our two vectors wo and wi as well as the normal vector (0, 0, 1) dictated by the spec. Then
        we implemented task 2, mirror material, involving the sample_f function. Following the spec, we set our pdf to 1
        and stored the reflection of wo to wi, and then returned reflectance / abs_cos_theta(*wi) to cancel out the cosine
        that at_least_one_bounce_radiance uses to multiply by. To implement refraction in task 3, we first checked the case
        for if there was total internal reflection. In this case, there is no refraction, and we return false. Else, we
        checked the sign of the z value of wo because the z value of wi should have the opposite sign, and if wo's z value
        is negative our n value is also ior because we are exiting instead of entering the non-air material. Finally in
        refract we set our wi to a new vector with the arguments detailed in the spec and we return true. In task 4, we
        implement glass material for our spheres, which we implemented by following the pseudocode outlined in the spec.
        We had some trouble with typos when implementing part 4 which took a while to debug and finally achieve the
        correct renders.
        </p>
            Let m indicate max ray depth for this paragraph. From m0 to m1, the new multibounce effect lights up the room.
            The spheres still remain dark
            because there is only 1 bounce of light that bounce off the spheres toward the camera. From m1 to m2,
            the left sphere is lit because the ray makes 2 bounces: 1 onto the sphere and the second a reflection
            off the sphere to show its mirror coating. From m2 to m3, the right sphere is lit now with a mirror coating
            because the ray now bounces on the sphere, enters, and exits to then appear with the mirror coating. From m3
            to m4, the forth ray bounces inside the left sphere to highlight the reflection of the right sphere on the
            left sphere. Also, the ray bounces off the right sphere to cast a refraction on the right wall. From m4 to
            m5, there is more bounce between the right sphere and its shadow on the ground, creating a brighter gradient
            on the bottom. From m5 to m100, the image overall is brighter because of more bounces throught the objects
            in the image and the wall. Higher bounce numbers indicate more light refraction in the image as well as
            clearer mirror images on the mirror surfaces of the left sphere.

    <h2 align="middle">Part 4: Depth of Field</h2>
    <p>In part 4, we implemented a thin lens camera model onto our rendering. In the pinhole camera model, we viewed the
        world from the camera only through a single point, the origin. In the thin lens model, we model it by viewing
        our camera through a lens, a circle with a radius, and have an adjustable focal distance. This allows us to play
        around with the aperture and focal distance. The thin lenses model is different because on the image plane, we
        now have multiple light rays coming from the circular lens and not just the one ray from the origin in a pinhole
        camera model. By having the thin lens model and being able to adjust the aperture and focal distance, we can
        adjust blur and focus in our image and create cool effects!</p>

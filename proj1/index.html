<p>Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this project. Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the project.</p>
<p>In this project, we implemented a Rasterizer for the svg file format. </p>
<h2 align="middle">Section I: Rasterization</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>
<p>In order to rasterize triangles, we will first create a bounding box for the triangle. Then for each point in the
triangle, we will use the three line test to find out whether the center of the pixel is inside the triangle. We will do
  the test by computing for the line between the edges of the triangle, computing the normal line perpendicular
  to the edge and testing whether the point is on the inside part of the line by taking the dot product of the two
  points. We do this for all the points and if the point is on the interior of the line for all of the lines, then
  we know that the point is on the inside of the triangle. </p>
<p>Here is an example 2x2 gridlike structure using an HTML table. Each <b>tr</b> is a row and each <b>td</b> is a column in that row. You might find this useful for framing and showing your result images in an organized fashion.</p>

<div align="middle">
  <table style="width=100%">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="images/part1_test4.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">test4 result</figcaption>
      </td>
    </tr>

  </table>
</div>


<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Antialiasing triangles</h3>
  <p>In supersampling, we will divide up each pixel into smaller segments and sample from each segment. This will
    allow us to reduce high frequencies and prevent jaggies. We do this by dividing each pixel into midpoints of the
    subsamples and averaging the values in the pixel to combine and create the final image.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
    This was implemented by adding two loops within each pixel to loop through each subsample sample_rate times. We
    still call the inside method to check if the subsample point is within the triangle and write the output the
    sample_buffer vector. This stores each pixel's subsample color points which we will then use to get the final
    color for the output. In the resolve_to_framebuffer method, we will find the final color for each pixel by
    averaging the subsample point colors and get our final image.
  </p>

  <div align="middle">
    <table style="width=100%">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <img src="images/part2_test4_1ss.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
          <figcaption align="middle">test4.svg 1 pixel subsample result</figcaption>
        </td>
        <td>
          <img src="images/part2_test4_4ss.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
          <figcaption align="middle">test4.svg 4 pixel subsample result</figcaption>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <br>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <img src="images/part2_test4_16ss.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
          <figcaption align="middle">test4.svg 16 pixel subsample result</figcaption>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

  <p>
    We see these results from increasing the subsampling size because we are reducing the size of the subsampling
    which leads to more smooth changes in the final image pixels. Gradual changes in colors allow us to reduce anti
    aliasing from jaggies and reducing the high frequency changes in the image.

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Barycentric coordinates</h3>
  Barycentric coordinates is a system of coordinates used for easily interpolating in any points of a triangle. By
  using the Barycentric coordinates we are able to easily see the proximity to each triangle's vertices and have the
  correct ratios between them. This allows us to have smooth transitions between colors or textures
  within a
  triangle which will contribute to antialiasing as well and makes it easier to sample points.

  <div align="middle">
    <table style="width=100%">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <img src="images/part4_test7.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
          <figcaption align="middle">test7.svg result</figcaption>
        </td>
        <td>
          <img src="images/part4_colortri.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
          <figcaption align="middle">color triangle using Barycentric coordinates</figcaption>
        </td>
      </tr>

    </table>
  </div>
  <p>
    In this example, with a triangle on the right side, we have a triangle with corners of red, blue, and green. The
    intermediate colors between them are created from the combination of relative proximities to each of the
    vertices. We can see that the middle of the triangle blends all of the colors together while the corners have the
    pure colors. 
  </p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>
<p>
  Pixel Sampling is the process of obtaining the pixel from a texture image onto the screen image. We can implement this by using
  nearest pixel or by bilinear sampling. These are two different methods of obtaining a corresponding screen image pixel from a
  point on the texture image. We can use nearest pixel to get the closest sampled pixel to our point on the texture image, we can
  do this by rounding our point and then sampling the texture image. The other process of bilinear sampling involves using a linear
  interpolation to get the final point which is interpolated between the 4 closest points to our point on the texture image.
  We can achieve this with a lerp function which will take a linear combination between points to give us an interpolated point.

    <table style="width=100%">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <img src="images/p5_nearest_1.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
          <figcaption align="middle">texmap/test5.svg nearest pixel sampling 1 subsample</figcaption>
        </td>
        <td>
          <img src="images/p5_bilinear_1.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
          <figcaption align="middle">texmap/test5.svg bilinear pixel sampling 1 subsample</figcaption>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <br>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <img src="images/p5_nearest_16.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
          <figcaption align="middle">texmap/test5.svg nearest pixel sampling 16 subsample</figcaption>
        </td>
        <td>
          <img src="images/p5_bilinear_16.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
          <figcaption align="middle">texmap/test5.svg bilinear pixel sampling 16 subsample</figcaption>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>
  <p>
    In these pictures, we can see that bilinear pixel sampling gives us an images that is blended more smoothly. The nearest
    pixel sampling with 1 subsample image is clearly very pixelated while bilinear helps smooth the texture out and subsampling
    will also have a similar result in creating an image that is more blurred and reduces antialiasing. There is a large difference
    between the pixel sampling methods is there is a high frequency change in the image where the nearest sampling will give
    very pixelated and jaggy result since it will take a single closest while bilinear pixel sampling will be able to blurr the image and take subsamples that are
    combined between multiple surrounding pixels.
  </p>


<h3 align="middle">Part 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h3>
<p>
	Level Sampling is the process of finding the right mipmap level to use for the corresponding image. We do this by
	taking the derivative of 1 pixel with respect to dx and dy, then using Barycentric coordinates to convert it into the
	uv space. This allows us to see how stretched out or compressed our image is and will allow us to determine which
	mipmap level the image should be at. We implemented mipmap level zero, nearest level sampling, and bilinear level. The
	mipmap level zeros uses only the level zero mipmap with the highest resolution. The nearest level sampling will calculate
	the max derivative and take the log base 2 then round to the nearest mipmap level. The bilinear level will interpolate between the
	two closes mipmap levels, taking the floor and ceiling of the level value, finding the texture color for both levels, then
	linearly interpolating between the two colors.
	<br/>
	Pixel sampling is able to run relatively quickly to the original algorithm since it will just be finding the point
	directly from the texture map, however bilinear pixel sampling may take up more time since we will need to do 3
	lerp functions, pixel sampling will be the worst at antialiasing power because it applies the pixel sampling over
	the entire image and can make the entire image crisp or blurry. Level sampling employs the use of mipmaps which are
	images but at multiple resolutions and uses the image to figure out the best mipmap level to use that will create
	the clearest image. This takes up more memory usage because we need to store the additional mipmaps however it
	performs well at antialiasing because it can change blurriness or reduce high frequencies at different areas. The
	runtime also takes a bit longer since we need to compute barycentric coordinates for different mipmap levels,
	however performs well at creating an image that is antialised.
	Changing the number of pixels allows us to create more subsamples per pixel and sample the image more. This works
	well at reducing high frequncy changes int eh image and thus works well for antialiasing, however it had a large
	impace on runtime in that each subsample must be sampled. The memory impact will depend on the number of subsamples
	since the memory storage for pixel colors will be multiplied by the number of subsamples.
